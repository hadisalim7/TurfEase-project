# TurfEase – Real-Time Turf Booking Application

## Project Overview
**TurfEase** is a Java-based, feature-rich application designed to **simplify turf bookings for sports facilities**. It provides a seamless experience for both users and turf managers (admins) by combining a real-time booking system with a modern, user-friendly interface.

With TurfEase, users can:
- Browse **all types of turfs** (football, cricket, badminton, etc.) available for booking.
- Book slots **in real time** with instant availability updates.
- View their **booking history** and manage (cancel/reschedule) bookings easily.
- Opt for **self-booking**, so offline bookings by users are also reflected in the system immediately.

Turf managers (admins) can:
- Manage **their own turf** with full control (multiple admins supported, but each admin manages only one turf).
- View, edit, or cancel bookings for their turf.
- Ensure **real-time slot availability** for all users.

TurfEase is built to simulate a **real-world turf booking app**, providing a professional and fully functional platform for sports enthusiasts and turf owners alike.
